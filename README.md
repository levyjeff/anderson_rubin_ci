# Anderson-Rubin Confidence Intervals
Calculates Anderson-Rubin confidence intervals for Python Statsmodels 2SLS output based on the "ivpack" library for R.

For more on why to use Anderson-Rubin CIs with your 2SLS models, see _“Weak Instruments in IV Regression: Theory and Practice”_ for a great overview.
